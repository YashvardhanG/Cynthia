<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

Cynthia is an Artificial Intelligent Computer Assistant. It can help you with various kinds of things and reduce your effort of opening and executing things.

Cynthia can execute basic functions like commencing a countdown, information about the weather, and even perform advanced task such as helping you in taking down notes and read them as well. This Assistant works in two modes, <bold>Voice</bold> and <bold>Text</bold> based modes. By default it runs in text mode (command prompt). The modes can easily be switched by just writing or speaking, 'change mode' as your command.

The purpose behind building this Computer Assistant is to reduce the effort that is required in performing very menial tasks. With this, you may open stuff in your browser, laptop, and further control it just by typing in a command or simply saying it out loud. The assistant is yet in it's initial stages and hence, the scope of commands and functionalities is limited. You may just fork this project, and recommended and add any sort of functionality which you think might add to the overall performance.

You may head on the the <a href="#working">Working</a> section to view the working process of the program and, go ahead and head on to the <a href="#developments">Development</a> pane to know the current developement goals with this project.

It has been completely developed using Python programming language, and hence, requires some modules. The list of required modules and installation commands have been given in the <a href="#requirements">next</a> section.
